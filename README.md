# Turtle Invaders
A rework of the classic retro game "**_Space Invaders_**" built with Python's Turtle module and tkinter. Dodge enemy projectiles, shoot invading turtles, and survive wave after wave in this retro-inspired mini-game!

## Concept
- You control a player ship at the bottom of the screen.
- Enemies descend in waves and shoot randomly.
- Avoid getting hit while shooting down as many enemies as possible.
- When you lose all lives, you get the option to restart and try again.
